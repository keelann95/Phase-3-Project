 # Contact Manager CLI

Welcome to the Contact Manager CLI, your command-line tool for managing contacts and groups efficiently!



## Instructions
For this project, you will interact with a command-line interface (CLI) to manage contacts and organize them into groups using an SQLite database. You can add, list, search, update, and delete contacts, as well as manage groups.

 
 ## Topics tested in this Code Challenge:
 
Implementing Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) with SQLAlchemy

Creating a command-line interface (CLI) to interact with the database

Managing relationships between models (e.g., Contacts and Groups)

CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) in Python using SQLAlchemy

  ## Core Deliverables
Add a New Contact: Add a contact with a name, phone number, email, and assign it to a group.


List All Contacts: View all saved contacts with their details.


Search Contacts by Group or Name: Search for contacts based on their group or name.
